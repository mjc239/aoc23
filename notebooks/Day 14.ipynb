The most natural direction to start with is west-east (as this is the direction in which the row strings span), so pick east as the default direction - this is convenient, is when a string of `O` and `#` characters is sorted, the `O`s end up on the eastern side. Here is how tilts in other directions can be converted into tilts in the east direction:\n",
